# Why I DevRel

This site is geared toward exploring why we do what we do. What makes us who we are and why that's led us to being DevRels.

If you are or have been a DevRel, you're welcome to contribute. It doesn't have to be much. Contributions can go from a sentence to a short story. The important thing is introspection.

## How to contribute

1. Fork this repository
2. Add a file in the `stories` directory named with your name (e.g. `/stories/your-name-here.md`)
3. The `title` frontmatter should be your name (or `anonymous` if you choose). An optional `link` frontmatter should you want to link to your twitter or personal site, etc.
4. The body of the markdown will be your story (however long)
5. If you want to control where the homepage breaks your story, use the `<!-- excerpt -->` tag in between paragraphs.
6. Issue a Pull Request back into this repository.
