## Want to add your story?

We all approach DevRel differently. We all got into the industry differently. Every story is an opportunity to learn from each other.

If you'd like to add your story (a whole post, a sentence, a video even?), fork [the repository](https://github.com/brob/whyidevrel.com) and add a new document in the `/stories` directory. 

Each markdown file should have 2 items in it's frontmatter: `title` (your name) and `link` (a link to your site/home on the web).
