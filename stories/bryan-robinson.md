I’m an educator. 

Not sure if that sounds cliche or not. I was asked last year about what I felt was at the heart of who I am, personally. I thought about that a lot and that was the conclusion I came to.



When I look at how I interact with people both personally and professionally, a lot of it ends up with a framing of wanting to help someone come to a stronger understanding of something. AKA Educating them.


My mother was a teacher and I grew up watching what that meant. 


In high school, I was never an official tutor, but in multiple classes, I was the one the other kids came to for help understanding concepts.



In college, I gravitated toward my university’s Philosophy department and ended up with a degree in Philosophy. In many ways, philosophy is about always learning and always teaching (sounds familiar to DevRel, honestly).


In my early career, I didn’t educate on “practical” knowledge, but I was an early “digital native” in newsrooms which were decidedly not. There was a lot of cultural education at work.


After cutting my teeth on development and learning how all the IE6/7 CSS bugs were, I started doing more and more education with my teammates about that sort of thing.


As my technical knowledge and skill grew, the scope of what I could teach and mentor grew as well. At work I was mentoring folks. In my spare time, I was creating presentations for meetups and just starting to dip my toe into Content Creation.


I noticed that it made me incredibly happy. More so than anything else professionally ever had. That’s when I decided to go all in on Dev Education and later DevRel.



To this day, knowing I helped someone understand a concept better (tech or not) is what drives me. 



Education is the “core” of me, I think. It’s DEFINITELY the core of why I DevRel.

I’d love to know why you do what you do.
